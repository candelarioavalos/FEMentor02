## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### What I learned

When I was trying to link the proper google fonts, I thought that the links at the style-guide for such purpose would work, but in my case, they didn't, so I went to w3schools to get the proper line of code in order to set that for each font.

Like in the previous task, I worked on three different css files, one css for general styles, one for mobile version and one more for desktop version, and it worked just great. I like this way of coding.
Also, I decided to set the break point for views to 1350 pixels, so, phone version for max-width: 1349px and desktop version for min-width: 1350px.

While coding the general css stiles file, I decided to create and use variable names for colors, that way I could easily choose the corresponding colors for fonts, backgrounds, etc.

For margins and paddings, I had to resize the view of the design images to decide how many pixels I was going to set for each of this elements and how to set them in order to set the apropriate spaces acording to the design images.


### Continued development

I'm excited to keep learning and practicing styles.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is the page where I have learned the most, they have a lot of easy to learn tutorials for web development and a lot of examples for every topic and language. I will keep studying at w3schools for a while, it is so exciting! Every time I need to see a code example, I search here first!

- [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is definitely a must while coding, I google everything I have a question abut all the time, and stackoverflow is always one of the options with the possible answer.
